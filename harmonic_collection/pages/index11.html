            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>When I first started this project, I had no idea what challenges lay ahead. My initial goals were ambitious, and I was eager to dive in and start creating.</p>
            <p>Choosing a topic like colorblindness creates a challenge, as the concept is much more abstract and interaction-based, with not a lot of concrete conent to play with.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="reflection-section">
            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>The biggest obstacle I encountered was learning to balance perfectionism with progress. Code was a brand new medium this semster, so balancing my ideas with my lack of technical abilities was difficult, with the added addition of concepualizing web-pages, a new medium.</p>

        <section class="reflection-section">
            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <p>This project taught me the importance of patience and persistence. Not everything works on the first attempt, and that's okay.</p>
            <p>I also discovered new technical skills and problem-solving approaches that I'll carry forward into future projects. It's ok to live in the discomfort of not having the abilities to do what you want to do, as this is a part of the design process that is meant to inform you and help you creativly problem solve and find alternative solutions.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="reflection-section">
            <h2>What I Would Do Differently</h2>
            <p>If I could start over, I would spend more time researching the topic, and looking at more visual inspiration. I would have also been more accpeting of the discomfort I described earlier."</p>
        </section>

        <section class="reflection-section">
            <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
            <p>This experience has shaped how I approach new challenges. I'm more confident in my abilities and more aware of areas where I can continue to grow. Additonally, it has helped me accept a part of the design process that allows for creative problem-solving.</p>
