        <p>Color blindness is a visual impairment that affects a person's ability to perceive colors accurately. It occurs when the color-detecting cells in the retina, known as cones, are absent or not functioning properly. This condition can make it difficult for individuals to distinguish between certain colors, particularly red and green, which are the most commonly affected hues.</p>

        <p>There are several types of color blindness, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Red-green color blindness:</strong> The most common form, affecting the ability to differentiate between red and green hues.</li>
            <li><strong>Blue-yellow color blindness:</strong> A rarer form that impacts the perception of blue and yellow colors.</li>
            <li><strong>Complete color blindness:</strong> A rare condition where individuals cannot perceive any colors at all, only shades of gray.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Color blindness is usually inherited and affects a significant portion of the population, particularly males. While there is no cure, various tools and strategies can help individuals manage the condition and improve their color perception.</p>
