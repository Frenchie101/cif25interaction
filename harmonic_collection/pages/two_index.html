        <h1>What Is Colorblindness?</h1>
        </div>
      <section class=" introduction">
            <p>
                <strong>Colorblindness</strong>, also known as 
                <strong>color vision deficiency</strong>, is a condition that affects the 
                way a person perceives colors. Individuals with colorblindness may have 
                difficulty distinguishing certain colors—most commonly reds, greens, and 
                sometimes blues. Instead of seeing the full spectrum of color, people with 
                color vision deficiency may see some colors as muted, similar, or easily 
                confused.
            </p>
            <p>
                The condition occurs when the <strong>cone cells</strong> in the retina—responsible 
                for detecting color—are missing, functioning improperly, or responding differently 
                to light. Normally, three types of cones sense red, green, or blue wavelengths. 
                When one type is altered or absent, color perception is affected.

            <h2>Types of Colorblindness</h2>

            <h3>Red–Green Colorblindness (Most Common)</h3>
            <p>
                This type makes it difficult to distinguish reds from greens or may cause these 
                colors to appear dull. It includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protanomaly / Protanopia</strong> – red cone deficiency</li>
                <li><strong>Deuteranomaly / Deuteranopia</strong> – green cone deficiency</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Blue–Yellow Colorblindness</h3>
            <p>
                Less common and affects the ability to tell apart blues from greens and yellows 
                from reds.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tritanomaly / Tritanopia</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Complete Colorblindness (Achromatopsia)</h3>
            <p>
                A rare condition in which individuals perceive little to no color. It may also 
                cause sensitivity to light and reduced visual clarity.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="causes">
            <h2>What Causes Colorblindness?</h2>
            <p>
                Most colorblindness is <strong>inherited</strong> and present from birth. Because 
                the genes controlling color vision are linked to the X chromosome, the condition 
                is more common in men than women.
            </p>
            <p>
                Color vision deficiency may also be <strong>acquired</strong> later in life due to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eye diseases (e.g., glaucoma, macular degeneration)</li>
                <li>Aging</li>
                <li>Eye or brain injuries</li>
                <li>Certain medications or chemical exposure</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="daily-life">
            <h2>How Colorblindness Affects Daily Life</h2>
            <p>
                While colorblindness does not usually impact overall visual sharpness, it can make 
                tasks such as reading color-coded information, identifying traffic signals, choosing 
                ripe fruits, or selecting matching clothing more challenging. Many individuals use 
                tools like color-identifying apps or specialized lenses to assist with color 
                differentiation.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="cure">
            <h2>Is There a Cure?</h2>
            <p>
                There is currently <strong>no cure</strong> for inherited colorblindness. However, 
                assistive technologies, accessibility tools, and adaptive learning strategies can 
                help individuals manage color-dependent tasks. In cases of acquired colorblindness, 
                treating the underlying condition may improve color perception.
